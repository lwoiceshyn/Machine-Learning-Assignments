# Machine-Learning-Assignments
Graduate-level assignments for machine learning at the University of Toronto.

## Assignment 1
In assignment 1, I implement and compare k-Nearest-Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and regularized Logistic Regression, compare and contrast them, and analyze the effects of varying hyperparameters.

## Assignment 2
In assignment 2, I implement and compare a Neural Network, a Convolutional Neural Network, and the Mixture of Gaussians algorith. I compare and contrast them, and analyze the effects of varying their respective hyperparameters.
